# Machine-Learning---Classification
This project was implemented as part of the ML-2 Module to perform classification using the various ML algorithms

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies, especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to predict potential customer to churn. Churning can happen due to various factors, ranging from customer dissatisfaction with the products or services being provided to availability of better or equivalent products/services at competitive prices. The main aim of our work is to build a churn prediction model which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are most likely subject to churn.
